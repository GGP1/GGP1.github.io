    content: |-
      I'm an autodidact Software Engineer passionate about computer science and economics.

      My journey began with curiosity about how computers work, leading me to spend countless hours learning and experimenting. This pursuit of knowledge continues to evolve every day.

      When I'm not coding, you'll often find me staying active through swimming, running, or playing football or tennis. These activities keep my mind sharp and 
      help me approach challenges with a fresh perspective.

      I'm also deeply interested in economics, particularly the fundamentals of money, macroeconomics, and praxeology. This curiosity shapes how I approach decision-making in an ever-changing world.

      Lately, I've been diving deep into the exciting field of AI, exploring techniques to enhance open-source LLMs. It's a rapidly evolving field, and I'm eager to share what I learn along the way.
