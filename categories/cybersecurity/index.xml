&lt;h3 id="unencrypted-services">Unencrypted services&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s clear that most people prioritize functionality and usability over security and privacy, they aren&amp;rsquo;t forced to use services lacking this last two principles but it&amp;rsquo;s still necessary to show them what really happens behind the scenes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until 2016 that Whatsapp implemented end-to-end encryption (basically anyone intercepting your&amp;rsquo;s smartphone traffic was able to read your conversations), or Zoom, whose calls were super unencrypted during the most of the 2020 and people still kept using them; Discord is another one offering unencrypted services.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
