&lt;p&gt;The main benefit chroot brought in was &lt;strong&gt;process isolation&lt;/strong&gt;, improving the system security such that an internal vulnerability wouldn&amp;rsquo;t affect external systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, chroot was the first of a series of technologies designed to protect each process from the others on the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Protect your information</title><link>https://gastonpalomeque.com/posts/protect_your_information/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gastonpalomeque.com/posts/protect_your_information/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Every day we are more connected with our devices, we use them to share information, store capital, buy products, work, learn, for entertainment; basically anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with these services come our accounts, that hold and will hold more value than ever as the time goes by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no doubt we need them safe. In this article, I will try to help you &lt;strong&gt;protect your information&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="passwords"&gt;Passwords&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passwords are the &lt;strong&gt;most critical part of every system security&lt;/strong&gt;, they are the key that protect very sensitive information so it&amp;rsquo;s specially important to understand how to manage them carefully.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
