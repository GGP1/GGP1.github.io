people&rsquo;s trust on the governments and institutions that rule them.</p><p>Central banks impose the currencies used and arbitrarily control money supply and interest rates. Their negligent manipulation have caused inflation and hiperinflation crises all over the world, driving people to look for better ways of storing their capital to protect it from money debasement.</p><p>The search for a solution along with the advances in computer science and cryptography led to the creation of a decentralized virtual system that does not require to trust on a third party to exchange assets in a secure, transparent and reliable manner. This system is called <strong>Bitcoin</strong>.</p><h1 id=history>History</h1><p>With World War II coming to and end in 1944, 44 alied nations celebrated the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system>Bretton Woods</a> agreement that established the rules, institutions and procedures that would regulate the international monetary system after the war.</p><p>The countries agreed on fixing their currencies to the U.S. dollar, and to tie the U.S. dollar to gold at a price of $35 per ounce. The currencies were now (supposedly) <strong>indirectly backed by and exchangeable for gold</strong>.</p><p><img src=/images/bretton_woods_conference.jpg alt="Bretton Woods Conference" title="Bretton Woods Conference"></p><p>A few years later, a series of conflicts known as the <a href=https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/cold-war-history>Cold War</a> started between the United States, the Soviet Union and their respective allies. To face them, the United States began spending high amounts of money and in 1950 its balance of payments swung negative.</p><p>What&rsquo;s worse, in 1964-1965 its president <strong>Lyndon Johnson</strong> launched the <a href=https://www.history.com/topics/1960s/great-society>Great Society Program</a>, a set of domestic programs to eliminate poverty, reduce crime, abolish inequality and improve the environment, which represented even more deficit.</p><p>As a consequence of all these spending, other countries became concern that the U.S. didn&rsquo;t have enough gold reserves to back the money that was being printed and started exchanging their dollars for gold and demanding physical delivery.</p><blockquote><p>Previously, the exchanges of currencies for gold were done within the banks of the U.S. to avoid the logistics of shipping the gold.</p></blockquote><p>To prevent the outflow of gold, the American President <strong>Richard Nixon</strong> suspended <em>&ldquo;temporarily&rdquo;</em> the convertibility of the U.S. dollar to gold or other reserve assets in August 15, 1971. In March 1973 the fixed exchange rate system became a floating exchange rate system, giving birth to <strong>fiat currencies</strong>.</p><p>Fiat currencies are, by definition, backed by <strong>nothing other than government promises and people&rsquo;s faith on them</strong>. They are measured only against each other and can be easily manipulated.</p><blockquote><p><a href=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fiat>Fiat</a> (decree) means &ldquo;authoritative or arbitrary order&rdquo;.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/images/fiat_currencies.jpg alt="Fiat currencies"></p><p>With the objective of offering an alternative to the traditional financial system, several entities tried implementing their own private currencies that were tied not to trust but to reserves of precious metals, like most nations used to do prior to the Bretton Woods agreement:</p><ul><li><strong>E-gold</strong>: a digital currency backed with gold coins and operated by Gold & Silver Reserve Inc. (U.S.) that allowed users to transfer value from one account to another instantly inside their website.</li><li><strong>Liberty Reserve</strong>: similarly to e-gold, it was a digital currency that let users transfer money through a website with low transaction fees. Deposited funds where converted to Liberty Reserve Dollars that were tied to the U.S. dollar or to ounces of gold.</li><li><strong>Liberty dollar</strong>: a private currency that was issued in minted metal rounds (similar to coins), gold and silver certificates and electronic currency (eLD). Liberty Dollars were backed by gold, silver, platinum, or copper.</li></ul><p>All three services were shut down by the United States government, charging their owners with federal crimes for money counterfeiting, laundering and conspiracy.</p><blockquote><p>The U.S. government also <a href=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/486>prohibited</a> the use of silver bullion, or any other metal coin or bar not issued under government authority, from being used as currency in commerce.</p></blockquote><p>These projects provided a refuge against fiat currencies&rsquo; inflation and a simple and fast way of transferring value, however, their users were <strong>still required to trust a central authority</strong> and their reserves and services management.</p><p>Many researchers and computer scientists became aware that removing trust from the equation could only be achieved by a <strong>decentralized and distributed system</strong>.</p><p>In 1998, <strong>Wei Dai</strong> <a href=http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt>revealed</a> <strong>B-Money</strong>, a distributed electronic cash system described by his author as <em>&ldquo;a scheme for a group of untraceable digital pseudonyms to pay each other with money and to enforce contracts amongst themselves without outside help&rdquo;</em>.</p><p>Wei&rsquo;s proposal emphasizes in <strong>users&rsquo; participation</strong> to maintain a separate database containing all participants&rsquo; accounts balances, solve computational problems to create money, and validate, conclude and enforce contracts.</p><blockquote><p>The idea of digital cash was originally introduced in a research paper called <em><a href=https://www.chaum.com/publications/Chaum-blind-signatures.PDF>&ldquo;Blind signatures for untraceable payments&rdquo;</a></em> wrote by <strong>David Chaum</strong> in 1983. However, David&rsquo;s goal wasn&rsquo;t a monetary reform but to give the individuals control over their own information.</p></blockquote><p>This same year, <strong><a href=https://nakamotoinstitute.org/bit-gold/>Bit Gold</a></strong> showed up. It was proposed by <strong>Nick Szabo</strong> in an attempt to provide a solution to money counterfeiting, theft and its value depending on a trusted central authority.</p><p>The idea behind Bit Gold was an online automated currency with <strong>minimal dependence on trusted third parties</strong> and that could be securely stored, transferred, and assayed with similar minimal trust.</p><p>In 2005, Nick wrote a <a href=https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2005/12/bit-gold.html>post</a> were he mentioned interesting notions like <strong>proof of work securely timestamped</strong>, <strong>distributed property title registry</strong> and a <strong>chain of string bits</strong>.</p><p>Altough B-Money and Bit Gold were never implemented, many of their concepts were later used in the creation of the first and currently most popular digital currency.</p><p>On February, 2009 an individual/group under the name of <strong>Satoshi Nakamoto</strong>, whose identity is still unknown, <a href=https://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source>posted</a> that he has developed a new open source P2P (peer-to-peer<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>) e-cash system called <strong><a href=https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf>Bitcoin</a></strong>.</p><p>Bitcoin replaces trust based models with a <strong>decentralized electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof</strong>.</p><h1 id=bitcoin>Bitcoin</h1><p>Bitcoin is a <strong>digital asset whose integrity is protected by cryptography</strong><sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>. It is decentralized, divisible and fungible.</p><p>In other words, it&rsquo;s essentially <strong>bits of information that represent value</strong> inside a virtual system, which is designed to provide a secure, transparent and reliable infrastructure for their exchange.</p><p><img src=/images/bitcoin.jpg alt=Bitcoin></p><p>Bitcoin offers a <strong>public way for two parties to exchange property titles with no trust on any third party</strong>.</p><p>They are easy to store and transport, and enable the possibility to transfer assets with no economic, geographical nor political limitations and without relying on states, banks or other central institutions for it.</p><p>The technology that powers Bitcoin and provides a way of achieving such challenges is known as <em>blockchain</em>.</p><h2 id=blockchain>Blockchain</h2><p>A blockchain is a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger><strong>distributed ledger</strong></a> (append-only database) managed by a decentralized network that stores information (typically transactions) grouped in blocks. Each block is linked to the previous one in the chain and contains:</p><ul><li>a <em>hash</em><sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup> of the current block&rsquo;s content</li><li>the hash of the previous block</li><li>a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce>nonce</a> (number used only once)</li><li>a timestamp</li><li>other information (bits, weight, size, merkle root, number of transactions, difficulty, etc.).</li></ul><p><img src=/images/blockchain_blocks.png alt="Blockchain blocks content" title="Blockchain blocks content"></p><p>These blocks are <strong>immutable</strong>, they cannot be modified once they are appended to the database.</p><p>The only way to change some information is to replace the entire block and produce the largest chain, as we will see later, this is <strong>extremelly difficult and lacks incentives</strong>.</p><p>This immutability provides great <strong>transparency</strong> to the system, absolutely all the blocks and their information can be seen by anyone, anytime. Take a look at the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain <a href=https://www.blockchain.com/btc/block/0>here</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Blockchains storing transactions within a block organize them by using a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree>merkle tree</a> to verify their integrity.</p></blockquote><p>For a block to take part of the blockchain, the <a href=https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Full_node>full nodes</a> on the network must agree that it contains legitimate information.</p><p>Each <em>full node</em> holds a copy of the entire database and validates that the transactions and blocks meet the <strong>blockchain&rsquo;s consensus rules</strong>, communicating its decisions to the others in the network. It also updates the copy as new blocks are added.</p><p>Coordinating all the nodes is a complex problem in a <strong>distributed system</strong> and the reason why many <strong>consensus mechanisms</strong> were created.</p><h3 id=distributed-systems-and-consensus-mechanisms>Distributed systems and consensus mechanisms</h3><p>A <strong>distributed system</strong> is a group of computers (also referred as nodes) operating independently and communicating between each other to exchange and agree on information to perform a task.</p><p><img src=/images/consensus_mechanisms.png alt="Consensus mechanisms"></p><p>A blockchain network is one of them, it requires to be <strong>reliable, consistent and fault-tolerant</strong> but also needs a way of ensuring that the nodes spend <strong>scarce resources</strong> (electricity, time, etc.) in order to be elegible and participate in the system, otherwise any of them could attempt to inject malicious blocks without much endeavor.</p><p>There are multiple mechanisms to achieve this, the two most used in blockchain technologies are <em>proof of work</em><sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup> and <em>proof of stake</em>.</p><h3 id=proof-of-work>Proof of work</h3><p>In a proof of work (PoW) system, blocks are added to the blockchain by <strong>miners</strong>, which are nodes that compete against each other to <strong>compute a hash</strong> that is lower than the <strong>target</strong><sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup>. This calculation is <strong>computationally expensive</strong>.</p><p>To produce the hash, a miner takes the current block content, the previous block&rsquo;s hash and a nonce (number used only once).</p><p>What miners try to brute-force is the <strong>nonce</strong>, they do the calculation over and over again changing its value to get different hashes and hopefully one that is correct.</p><blockquote><p>The target difficulty is adjusted by reducing its value (hence reducing the probability of getting a valid hash) to keep block creation at a certain rate (1 per 10 minutes in the case of Bitcoin).</p></blockquote><p>Once a miner finds (or thinks it has) the solution, it broadcasts the hash to the other nodes for them to verify if it is correct, this is done fast as the verification demands a single calculation.</p><p>In case the solution is valid, the miner is <strong>rewarded</strong> with a pre-established amount of coins that may or may not vary over time depending on how the system is configured.</p><p><img src=/images/pow.jpg alt="Proof of work" title="Proof of work"></p><p>In a blockchain using proof of work, its security relies on the <strong>difficulty of accumulating CPU power</strong>.</p><p>The network always trusts and replicates the <strong>longest</strong> valid chain, hence, corrupting it is only possible by <strong>mining faster than the rest of the network</strong> (having more than 50% of the network&rsquo;s CPU power), this is, producing the longest branch of blocks and making the nodes discard the &ldquo;honest&rdquo; one.</p><p>This attack can change the current/future transactions but won&rsquo;t affect previously stored ones. Modifying a past transaction is even harder:</p><p><img src=/images/proof_of_work.png alt="Proof of work attack"></p><h4 id=computational-scalability>Computational scalability</h4><p>As the probability of guessing a right hash is <strong>directly proportional</strong> to the hashes per second the miner is able to perform, there is a race going on to make those hashes as fast as possible, which translates in high levels of electricity consumption.</p><p>This is one of the main criticisms to proof of work systems, considered by some as <em>&ldquo;extremely inefficient&rdquo;</em>. However, it&rsquo;s clear that such an effort needs to be made to keep the blockchain secure and thus, <strong>protect the users&rsquo; property</strong>.</p><p>Cryptocurrencies using a proof of work system <strong>trade computational scalability for social scalability</strong><sup id=fnref:6><a href=#fn:6 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>6</a></sup>.</p><p><img src=/images/crypto_mine.jpg alt="Cryptocurrency mine" title="Thousands of computers calculating hashes in a cryptocurrency mine"></p><h2 id=finance>Finance</h2><p>Now that we know what a blockchain is and what it can be used for, let&rsquo;s get an insight on Bitcoin price and how users store and exchange satoshis (Bitcoin&rsquo;s smallest denomination).</p><h3 id=wallets>Wallets</h3><p>The users, in order to interact with the blockchain and make transactions, need a <strong>wallet</strong>. A wallet is an application that acts as an interface for the users to send and receive coins inside the blockchain. Each wallet has a <strong>public and private key</strong> which are used to <strong>sign and verify</strong> transactions.</p><p>The public key is used to identify a wallet, it could be thought as a unique address/username.</p><p>The private key is required to verify the ownership of the coins that are under the wallet with its public key pair. Losing it means losing access to all the coins.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Important</strong>: when you buy Bitcoin in an exchange, they are stored in a wallet owned by that exchange, it&rsquo;s not safe to keep the coins there as they are the main target of cybercriminals, plus you don&rsquo;t really own them. When you withdraw your funds is when they are sent to your wallet (the one protected by your private key and under your control). Not your keys, not your coins.</p></blockquote><p>Wallets are tipically divided by their internet connectivity into two categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Hot wallets</strong>: they are connected to the internet and suitable for daily transactions but not for long-term holding as they are more prone to attacks.</li><li><strong>Cold wallets</strong>: they offer higher security by handling the keys in an isolated and offline device (or a paper), ideally for holding.</li></ul><blockquote><p>The two most used types of wallets are hardware and software (desktop, mobile, web) but their differences won&rsquo;t be covered in this post, I invite you to investigate yourself.</p></blockquote><h3 id=transactions>Transactions</h3><p>Transactions are token transfers between two users <strong>within the blockchain</strong> and each one of them has a <strong>fee</strong> that is rewarded to the miner for calculating the hash of the block.</p><p>Users are in charge of choosing the amount they want to destinate to the fee, transactions offering a higher reward/byte ratio will be prioritized and those who offer a lower one are in risk of not being even considered by the miners. This means that transferring 1 coin costs almost the same as transferring 1.000.000 of them.</p><h4 id=double-spending>Double spending</h4><p>One of the main concerns of past implementations of electronic payments was <strong>double-spending</strong>, which is solved in Bitcoin by recording and agreeing a single public history of the transactions in the order they were received, considering the earliest as the valid one.</p><h3 id=price>Price</h3><p>The price of Bitcoin, like any economic asset, fluctuates based on <strong>supply and demand</strong>.</p><p>In Bitcoin, <strong>the supply is fixed</strong> to 21 million units, making it scarce and predictable by definition, as well as eliminating monetary inflation after the date set. This is why the term <strong>digital gold</strong> is often used.</p><p>In spite of this comparison, note that the amount of available gold is, even though barely increasing, still unknown and more could be found on earth or space.</p><p><img src=/images/bitcoin_time_vs_inflation.png alt="Bitcoin inflation vs time"></p><p>Unlike fiat currencies, Bitcoin units are not created out of thin air, but require miners to spend <strong>scarce resources</strong> like time and electricity for it.</p><p>Furthemore, many of the coins fall out of circulation due to the owners losing access to their private key and thus to the coins, reducing the available supply even more.</p><blockquote><p>I will be writing an article about money, if Bitcoin can be considered money and comparing it with fiat and commodity currencies.</p></blockquote><h3 id=volatility>Volatility</h3><p>Bitcoin is well-known for being volatile, one of the core reasons for this is that it&rsquo;s an <strong>emerging</strong> and <strong>immature</strong> market.</p><p>The introduction of a new technology that attempts to replace traditional institutions generates a lot of uncertainity and speculation, which derives in the variation of the consumers&rsquo; appreciation about the value of it.</p><p>If all the prices in the economy were removed, we would be in a similar situation where people would offer significantly different amounts of money for the same product.</p><p>We can expect the price to stabilize as Bitcoin adoption increases and more liquidity enters the market.</p><p><img src=/images/price.png alt=Price></p><h2 id=fundamental-principles>Fundamental principles</h2><h3 id=decentralization>Decentralization</h3><p>Bitcoin has opened up the possibility of exchanging assets in a secure and reliable way with no central authority being capable of controlling the transactions nor the system in which they are executed.</p><p>This is, decentralization <strong>eliminates the single point of failure of a system</strong> as there&rsquo;s no authority whose decisions could impact its functionality.</p><p>At the same time, it makes the system virtually impossible to stop or shut down. Each node has a copy of the database and as long as they can communicate between each other it will keep working.</p><p>However, it&rsquo;s not an intrinsic characteristic of cryptocurrencies, in fact, centralized ones controlled by a state, bank, company or institution exist.</p><h3 id=anonymity-and-pseudonymity>Anonymity and pseudonymity</h3><p>Blockchains were originally designed to be pseudonymous - they use hashes to identify users instead of personal information -, but when users interact with them anonymity becomes really tricky.</p><p>Centralized exchanges and applications that offer an interface to operate with the blockchain or companies that accept cryptos as a form of payment <strong>must verify the identity of their users</strong>, otherwise they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to recognise who is sending/receiving currencies.</p><p>Depending on their location they could also be under Know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) regulations, being required to provide sensitive information to the authorities in order to operate.</p><blockquote><p>Decentralized exchanges, however, tend to be more private as they only operate with information inside the blockchain and under less regulations as they are not in control of the funds.</p></blockquote><p>Futhermore, every single transaction remains in the immutable ledger <strong>forever</strong>. If your account&rsquo;s public key is associated with your identity, <strong>absolutely all</strong> the transactions you have made in the past are now exposed, as well as the public key addresses of the parties that interacted with you - whose identities can be linked as well.</p><h3 id=transparency>Transparency</h3><p>Instead of trusting a central authority, <strong>Bitcoin puts trust in code</strong> (cryptographic proofs), which in most cases is <strong>public and free to copy and modify</strong>.</p><p>It&rsquo;s important to note that Bitcoin is not a single software project but a protocol that may be implemented by any number of clients which are in turn developed and maintained by a group of developers that have permissions to commit to the project.</p><p>In many cases, potential changes in the codebase are <strong>deeply discussed and reviewed</strong> by the community members before implemented, however, this might not be done in all of the projects. Bitcoin clients that do not comply with the consensus rules will have their transactions and blocks rejected by the other compliant clients.</p><blockquote><p>When two groups differ radically in the scope of the project a <a href=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hard-fork.asp>hard fork</a> can be produced, where one group stays with the current state and the other copies and modifies it to meet their needs. In these cases, the new version gives each of the nodes the same amount of coins that had in the old version.</p></blockquote><p><img src=/images/bitcoin_source_code.jpg alt="Bitcoin Core source code" title="Bitcoin Core source code"></p><p>Open-source means the code is open to the public and that <strong>anyone</strong> can read the codebase of the project and <strong>verify</strong> that what is being promoted is actually how it works.</p><p>I implemented a simplified version of Bitcoin which contains most of its core features and allows the user to run a simulated peer-to-peer network with several nodes communicating between them. The project is called <a href=https://www.github.com/GGP1/btcs>btcs</a>.</p><h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h1><p>Cryptography, economics and computer science have been combined for the creation of a digital system that aims to improve the way in which multiple parties interact.</p><p>Agreements that previously required to trust an intermediary to supervise them now can be executed in a predictable way by a publicly accessible algorithm.</p><p>Bitcoin merely represents value and works as a medium of exchange inside those systems.</p><p>It&rsquo;s uncertain if this project will be the one used to make daily transactions in the future, but they are clearly a big step towards the decentralization and digitalization of human&rsquo;s communications.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>Peer-to-peer refers to an operation done by members of the same network without relying on a dedicated central server.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2><p>Cryptography is a process that ensures the confidentiality and integrity of some data by converting it in an unintelligible form.
